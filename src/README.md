# User Management Dashboard

## Overview
This is a React-based user management dashboard that allows authenticated users to view a paginated list of users, edit user details, and manage authentication. The backend provides user data, and authentication is managed using a token-based system.

## Features
- **User Authentication** (Login & Logout)
- **Protected Routes** (Using `PrivateRoute`)
- **Paginated User List** (Fetched from an API)
- **User Profile Display** (With Avatar, Name, and Email)
- **User Editing** (Navigation to the edit page)
- **Logout Functionality**

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Backend API** (If using a custom backend, ensure it's running)

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

Note : Since The api provided for this assignment is a dummy api the edit changes doesn't take place as the backend is not being updated, but the edit functionality in the project works well for the real api.
